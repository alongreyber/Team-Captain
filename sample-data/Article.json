If you are not fulfilling these requirements that is grounds for not being on the leadership team. Every week you will turn in these required documents for review by mentors. Please start working on these tasks before they are due so that you can get them done.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these tasks, leadership must have a project management system. We recommend Trello or Asana. When a subteam is asked to complete a task, this task must be input into the project management system. This helps with accountability.", "topic": {"$oid": "5ce70d5e018dcd3849d7f2de"}}]
